# üõ°Ô∏è Incident Response Review: E-Commerce Data Breach Case

## üîç Scenario Overview

As part of my role as a Level 1 SOC Analyst at a retail company, I reviewed the final report of a significant security incident that occurred prior to my employment. This activity supports the **Post-Incident Review** phase of the [NIST Incident Response Lifecycle](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf), focusing on lessons learned and strengthening defenses against future threats.

## üìå Executive Summary

- **Date of Incident**: December 28, 2022, 7:20 PM PT  
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to ~50,000 customer records, including PII and financial data  
- **Estimated Financial Loss**: $100,000  
- **Root Cause**: Exploited URL-based vulnerability (forced browsing)

## üìÖ Timeline Highlights

| Date             | Event                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dec 22, 2022     | Initial extortion email received by employee‚Äîmarked as spam          |
| Dec 28, 2022     | Follow-up email sent with sample stolen data, higher ransom demand   |
| Dec 28‚Äì31, 2022  | Security team investigation; root cause and data exposure confirmed  |

## üß™ Investigation Findings

- The attacker exploited a **forced browsing vulnerability** within the e-commerce platform by altering order numbers in the URL, allowing access to thousands of unique customer order pages.
- Web server logs confirmed sequential scraping behavior.
- No authentication was required for accessing purchase confirmation pages.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Response Actions

- Public disclosure of breach and customer notification
- Complimentary identity protection services provided to victims
- Log analysis pinpointed the high-volume, programmatic access

---

## üß≠ Recommendations

- **Routine vulnerability scans** and **penetration testing**
- **Access control improvements**, including:
  - **Allowlisting** for known URLs
  - **Authentication enforcement** on sensitive endpoints

## üß± Pyramid of Pain Tie-In

This incident underscores how **observable indicators like URLs and file access patterns (TTPs)**‚Äîwhich reside high on the Pyramid of Pain‚Äîcan provide more meaningful, proactive defense opportunities than simple hashes or IPs. By remediating behavioral patterns such as forced browsing and improving authorization logic, the organization can *significantly increase the pain* for future attackers.
