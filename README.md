## 📊 Pyramid of Pain Malware Investigation

I used VirusTotal to analyze a suspicious file and documented the findings using the Pyramid of Pain model.

**SHA256 analyzed:** `54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b`

The malware was identified as Flagpro, linked to the APT group BlackTech.

Indicators of compromise (IoCs) were documented using a slide template. [View the Google Slides template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/100DBHBMbzkYcWo6tNu5lsB9eSsM9snMe71Oxm5WtUEw/edit?usp=sharing).
