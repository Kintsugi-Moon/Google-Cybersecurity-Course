# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## System Description
The assessment focused on a small business inventory management application running on a Linux web server. The system handles product data and customer orders and is accessible to employees through a browser-based interface.

## Assessment Tools and Methodology
- **Nmap** to scan open ports and identify running services
- **OpenVAS** for vulnerability scanning of the operating system and installed packages
- **Manual review** of server configuration files to check for insecure settings

## Findings
1. **Outdated software packages** were discovered that contained known security vulnerabilities.
2. **SSH** was configured to allow password authentication, increasing the risk of brute-force attacks.
3. **Directory listing** was enabled in the web server, revealing file paths and internal structure.

## Remediation Strategy
- Update all packages to the latest stable versions and schedule regular patching.
- Restrict SSH to key-based authentication only and disable password logins.
- Disable directory listing in the web server configuration and limit access to sensitive directories.

## Lessons Learned
Regular vulnerability assessments help uncover misconfigurations and outdated software before attackers can exploit them. Implementing a routine review process and timely patch management greatly reduces risk.
