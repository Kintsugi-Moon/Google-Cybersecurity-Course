# üìÇ Phishing Incident Analysis & Response

This case study presents a complete cybersecurity incident workflow conducted as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** program. It includes:

- Malware analysis using VirusTotal
- Mapping Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to the Pyramid of Pain
- Completing and escalating a phishing alert ticket

This exercise demonstrates the ability to analyze malicious files, identify threats, and follow playbook procedures for proper response.

## üî∫ Pyramid of Pain Analysis

This section summarizes findings from the VirusTotal analysis of a known malicious file hash and maps them to IoCs in the **Pyramid of Pain** framework.

### üß™ File Hash Investigated

```plaintext
SHA256: 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b
```

**Key Findings**

- **Vendor Detections:** 41 security vendors flagged this file as malicious
- **Community Score:** Negative reputation
- **Malware Family:** Often associated with `Trojan.PSW.Agent` and similar variants

### üìä Indicators of Compromise

| Category | Example IoC | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Hash Value** | `e365ef2ec9441f15...` (SHA1/SHA512 variants) | Used to uniquely identify the malicious file |
| **IP Address** | `20.83.144.107` | Contacted IP during execution (observed in VirusTotal behavior) |
| **Domain Name** | `office365-appsync[.]online` | Malicious domain contacted during payload execution |
| **TTPs** | MITRE ATT&CK `T1059` (Command and Scripting Interpreter) | Used scripting techniques to execute malicious commands |

## üõ°Ô∏è Completed Phishing Alert Ticket

The following ticket documents the incident response workflow related to the phishing attack that deployed the file analyzed above.

### üßæ Alert Ticket Details

| Ticket ID | Alert Message | Severity | Details | Ticket Status |
|-----------|---------------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **A-2703** | SERVER-MAIL Phishing attempt possible download of malware | Medium | The user may have opened a malicious email and opened attachments or clicked links. | Escalated |

### üìù Ticket Comments

The alert detected that an employee downloaded and opened a malicious file from a phishing email. There was an inconsistency between the sender‚Äôs email address (`76tguy6hh6tgftrt7tg.su`), the name used in the email body ("Clyde West"), and the sender‚Äôs name, "Def Communications." The email body and subject line also contained grammatical errors.

The email‚Äôs body included a password-protected attachment, **bfsvc.exe**, which was downloaded and opened on the affected machine. Having previously investigated the file hash, it is confirmed to be a known malicious file. The alert severity is reported as medium, so the ticket was escalated to a level-two SOC analyst for further action.
